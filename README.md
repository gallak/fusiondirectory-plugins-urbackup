# fusiondirectory-plugins-urbackup

This plugin make the links between [FusionDirectory](https://www.fusiondirectory.org) 
and [urbackup urbackup system](https://urbackup.org) ( thanks Martin ! you saved some scientist life !!).
It isn't an alternative to the main web interface of urbackup, just a technical view for IT services

This plugin allows to follow :

* backup per system
* see old backup
* current backup

In the future, it will allow to lauch a full / incremental  file/image backup

## in the future

* We need to rewrite the php library for connecting to urbackup server
